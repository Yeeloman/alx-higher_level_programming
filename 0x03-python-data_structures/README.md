# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, we explore the concepts of lists and tuples in Python, which are sequence data types.

## Function Prototypes

The project includes several functions, each with its own prototype:

1. `print_list_integer(my_list=[])`: This function prints all integers of a list, one per line.
2. `element_at(my_list, idx)`: Retrieves an element from a list.
3. `replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`: Replaces an element of a list at a specific position.
4. `print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[])`: Prints all integers of a list in reverse order, one per line.
5. `new_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`: Replaces an element of a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
6. `no_c(my_string)`: Removes all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C' from a string and returns the modified string.
7. `print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]])`: Prints a matrix of integers, one row per line.
8. `add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=())`: Adds two tuples and returns a new tuple with the addition of their corresponding elements.
9. `multiple_returns(sentence)`: Returns a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character.
10. `max_integer(my_list=[])`: Finds the maximum integer in a list.
11. `divisible_by_2(my_list=[])`: Finds all multiples of 2 in a list and returns a new list with `True` or `False` values indicating whether each element is a multiple of 2.
12. `delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0)`: Deletes an item at a specific position in a list.
13. `switch(a, b)`: Switches the values of two variables, `a` and `b`.
14. `is_palindrome(list)`: Checks if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.
15. `print_python_list_info(p)`: Prints basic information about Python lists.

Please refer to the individual files mentioned above for the implementation details of each function.

## Tasks

The project includes several tasks, each with its own description and associated Python file:

1. **Print a list of integers**: Implements a function to print all integers of a list, one per line.
2. **Secure access to an element in a list**: Implements a function to retrieve an element from a list, with error handling for out-of-range indices.
3. **Replace element**: Implements a function to replace an element of a list at a specific position.
4. **Print a list of integers... in reverse!**: Implements a function to print all integers of a list in reverse order, one per line.
5. **Replace in a copy**: Implements a function to replace an element of a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
6. **Can you C me now?**: Implements a function to remove all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
7. **Lists of lists = Matrix**: Implements a function to print a matrix of integers, one row per line.
8. **Tuples addition**: Implements a function to add two tuples and return a new tuple with the addition of their corresponding elements.
9. **More returns!**: Implements a function to return a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
10. **Find the max**: Implements a function to find the biggest integer in a list.
11. **Only by 2**: Implements a function to find all multiples of 2 in a list and return a new list with Boolean values indicating whether each element is a multiple of 2.
12. **Delete at**: Implements a function to delete an item at a specific position in a list.
13. **Switch**: Implements a program that switches the values of two variables `a` and `b`.
14. **Linked list palindrome**: Implements a function to check if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.
15. **CPython #0: Python lists**: Implements a C function that prints basic information about Python lists.
