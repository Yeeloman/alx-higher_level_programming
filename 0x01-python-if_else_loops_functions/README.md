# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project was completed by Rosita Uqueio as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. In this project, I learned how to use conditionals and loops in Python by using the `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and `for` loops. I also practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about the scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

## Description :pencil2:

This project consists of several tasks that practice different concepts related to if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. Each task includes a Python file containing the implementation of the solution to the problem and a main file to test the function.

## Tasks :clipboard:

The table below outlines the tasks involved in this project:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task 0 | A function that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. |
| Task 1 | A function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| Task 2 | A program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase. |
| Task 3 | A program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`. |
| Task 4 | A program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal. |
| Task 5 | A program that prints all possible combinations of two digits. |
| Task 6 | A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. |
| Task 7 | A function that checks if a letter is lowercase. |
| Task 8 | A function that converts a string to uppercase letters. |
| Task 9 | A function that prints the last digit of a number without using `str` or `math` modules. |
| Task 10 | A function that adds two integers without using `+` or `-` operators. |
| Task 11 | A function that computes `a` to the power of `b` without using `**` operator. |
| Task 12 | A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100` followed by a new line and for multiples of three, prints `Fizz` instead of the number, for multiples of five, prints `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`.|
| Task 13 | A C function that inserts a node into a sorted singly linked list. |
| Task 14 | A program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase. |
| Task 15 | A function that removes a character at a given position from a string. |
| Task 16 | A function that matches a given byte code in Python. |

## Requirements :heavy_check_mark:

* Languages: Python and C
* Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Style: All files are created and executed using PEP 8 style

## Getting Started :rocket:

To run and test the implementation of the functions in this project, the following steps can be followed:

1. Clone the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RosieU/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions.git
```

2. Move to the repository folder

```
$ cd 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
```

3. Run any of the Python files to test the function implementation

```
$ python3 main.py
```

4. Alternatively, compile any of the C files provided in the repository and test the solutions as necessary.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 13-main.c 13-insert_number.c linked_lists.c -o insert
$ ./insert
```
